Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident
Issue Summary:
Duration: The outage occurred on November 10, 2023, starting at 15:45 UTC and was resolved by 18:30 UTC, resulting in an outage duration of 2 hours and 45 minutes.
Impact: The web application experienced intermittent slowdowns, causing a degradation in user experience. Approximately 30% of users were affected, reporting delays in accessing key features and content.
Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was identified as a database connection pool exhaustion due to a sudden spike in user traffic. The system was not adequately configured to handle the unexpected increase in demand.
Timeline:
•	Detection:
•	Detected at 15:45 UTC through automated monitoring alerts indicating increased response times and database connection errors.
•	Investigation:
•	Initial assumption: Investigated potential DDoS attack due to the sudden traffic surge.
•	Engaged the network and security teams to analyze incoming traffic patterns.
•	Discovered no evidence of a DDoS attack, shifting focus to internal system issues.
•	Escalation:
•	Escalated the incident to the DevOps and Database teams at 16:15 UTC.
•	Collaborated with frontend engineers to gather user-reported issues for a more comprehensive understanding.
•	Resolution:
•	Identified the root cause at 17:30 UTC, recognizing the exhaustion of the database connection pool.
•	Implemented a temporary fix by increasing the connection pool size.
•	Monitored the system to confirm the restoration of normal operations.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause Explanation: The database connection pool was set to a fixed size that couldn't dynamically adjust to sudden traffic spikes. As a result, the pool was exhausted, leading to delayed database queries and impacting the entire application.
Resolution Details: To address the issue, we dynamically adjusted the database connection pool size based on traffic demand. Additionally, we optimized database queries and added horizontal scaling to the database cluster to ensure it could handle increased loads.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Areas for Improvement:
1.	Dynamic Scaling: Implement auto-scaling mechanisms for critical components like the database connection pool to handle traffic fluctuations.
2.	Load Testing: Regularly conduct load testing to simulate traffic spikes and identify potential bottlenecks before they impact users.
3.	Monitoring Enhancements: Enhance monitoring to provide more granular insights into system performance, enabling quicker detection of anomalies.
Tasks for Issue Resolution:
1.	Database Configuration Update: Implement dynamic scaling for the database connection pool (TODO: Completed on Nov 10, 2023).
2.	Load Testing Automation: Develop automated scripts for regular load testing (TODO: To be completed by Nov 30, 2023).
3.	Monitoring Overhaul: Enhance monitoring tools to include more detailed metrics on database performance (TODO: To be completed by Dec 15, 2023).
This postmortem outlines the key aspects of the recent web stack outage, detailing the timeline, root cause, resolution, and measures for improvement. By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to fortify our system against similar incidents in the future.
